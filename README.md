# Quarto course website template

A template for course websites developed with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and hosted on GitHub.

This is all configured so you only need to edit the source files in Quarto (.qmd). The website is generated and hosted automatically by GitHub.

Example website: https://pakillo.github.io/quarto-course-website-template (see also https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/teach-ds-course-website for a more developed example).


## Using this template

1. Click on green button "Use this template" -> "Create a new repository"

2. Choose a name for your repository

3. Important: check 'Include all branches' when creating the repository (because we will need the `gh-pages` branch to host the website).

4. Once your repo is created, remember to update the links to your GitHub repo in [_quarto.yml](_quarto.yml), replacing 'Pakillo' with your GitHub username.
